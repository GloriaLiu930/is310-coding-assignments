# AgeOfAuthorsAndNovelSuccess

**Introduction**

This Jupyter Notebook explores the relationship between an author's age at the time of publication and various success metrics for novels, based on data from the Goodreads Top Ranked Novels dataset. The analysis focuses on understanding how author age may influence a book's popularity, genre preferences, and reader reception.

**Objectives**

1. Identify Age Patterns in Publication: We start by examining the distribution of author ages at the time of publication to determine if there are common age ranges associated with successful novel publication.

2. Analyze Author Age vs. Goodreads Ratings: By comparing author age with average Goodreads ratings, we aim to understand if an authorâ€™s age correlates with reader satisfaction or popularity.

3. Explore Genre Preferences by Author Age: Lastly, we examine the age distribution across different genres to see if certain genres are more popular among authors at specific life stages.

**Note**

You do not need to install any extra library since I already install them directly in the notebook =)
