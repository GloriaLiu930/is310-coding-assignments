# Web Scraping Assignment: Harry Potter List of Deaths

This project involves scraping the list of character deaths from the Harry Potter fandom wiki page.

- **URL Scraped:** https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/List_of_deaths
- **Robots.txt:** https://harrypotter.fandom.com/robots.txt (scraping is allowed for this site)

I chose this page because the list of deaths in Harry Potter represents significant plot points in the series. This data is valuable for analyzing narrative structures, character development, and themes of loss and sacrifice.

**Data Saved:** Multiple tables are scraped from the page and saved in CSV format.
