# API Getting Data - Culture Exploration

## Overview
Due to I'm a cat person. This project retrieves data from two APIs: the **MeowFacts API** for random cat facts and the **Europeana API** for related cultural artifacts. The script `getting_culture.py` fetches a fun fact about cats and searches for related items in Europeanaâ€™s digital collection (if it exists).

## How to Use
1. **Europeana API Key**: Before running, add your Europeana API key in the script under `europeana_api_key`.
   Here's how to get your API key:
   
   a. Visit the link: https://pro.europeana.eu/pages/get-api
   
   b. Sign up by using your @illinois.edu email address
   
   c. The Application or Project Name is IS310 Computing in the Humanities Course
   
   d. The website is either your .github.io website or our course website https://cultureasdata-uiuc.github.io/is310-fall-2024/

Once you have applied, you should see your API key in your inbox in a few minutes.

2. **Run the Script**:
   ```bash
   python3 getting_culture.py

## Note
I already remove my API keys for security reasons, please remember to replace with your API keys.
