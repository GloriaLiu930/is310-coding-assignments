**Web Technologies Used**:

-HTML: Used to structure the content, as seen in the "html", "head", "body", and other elements.

-CSS: External stylesheets like .css files manage the design and layout. Example: styles linked in the header or inline styles in the source code.

-JavaScript: Files like easy-search.js and spotlight.js are responsible for interactive elements.

**Who Built the Site?**:

University of Illinois Library IT team. However, I can't tell how many people built the web since there are no public members on GitHub =(. But I found the tech support team, so I just assumed all of them were getting in, thus will be 10.
